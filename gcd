/*
I am curious about . when I se the value gcd(22,8)


(22,8) -> (8,6) stacked. -> (6,2) stacked , ->(2,0) ->return 2;

now (6,2) , (8,6) is not popped. how could this function result 2?



I got the new info -> even if there are not popped from the stack . when the value is returned.
regardless of the rest of stacks . it will be terminated.


there is difference beteween gcd and factorial.

in factorial code , when the stack could be stacked again via popped stack. but gcd is not . cuz of else statement.

*/
int gcd(int x , int y) {

	if (y == 0)
		return x;
	else // this is the key . -> if is True so . it just return the x, not checking the else statement.
	{
		return gcd(y, x % y);
	}

}

int main() {

	printf("%d", gcd(22, 8));
}
