//code review how this work -> let'say Judge the number 11 is prime number or not . so . we gonna access the prime array and get the value 2 , 3 ,5 ,7 ->
// now is point. I gonna check only square number smaller than 11. because. if 4, 9 ( 5*5 is already bigger . so no need to check) -> is not prime number .so we can check with
// only two variable. 4, 9 -> if 11 was diveded 4, 9 -> it will be devided 2, 3 as well. so this is the solution. don't check, no need to check.






int main() {

	int prime[1024];
	int index = 0;
	prime[index++] = 2;
	prime[index++] = 3;

	 // prime number .
	for (int n = 5; n < 1000; n += 2)
	{
